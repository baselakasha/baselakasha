## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Basel. A web developer and programmer

ðŸ’¡ You can visit my portfolio: [https://www.baselakasha.com](https://www.baselakasha.com)

## About
I am someone who thinks differently and critically. My passion for technology combined with my curiosity led me to learn to program. I continued developing my software development skills using self-learning methods, taking online courses and reading books. I like to try things out as I enjoy learning and gaining new skills.
